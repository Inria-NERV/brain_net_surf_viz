# brain_net_surf_viz
contains codes ready to use to vizualize network metrics using nodes size/color or surface color

script_brain_surface_backboneNet_2glb.m is a script that creates a colored surface in the left hemisphere and generates a network for the right hemisphere using spheres linked by cylinders.

Ultimately, it gathers all the graphic objects and stacks them in one using vertices faces and colors to write a .glb 3D file readable by PowerPoint to create moving transitions.
